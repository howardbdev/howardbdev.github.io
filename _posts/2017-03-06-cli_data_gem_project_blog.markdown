Looking back, I'd say I've come a long way from where I started with Ruby! And even though it's still just the beginning, having a project that actually works and does something cool is immensely satisfying in a way that none of the smaller labs are. When I was growing up, every year I got one of those word-of-the-day calendars -- the square ones that look like giant post-it note stacks and you tear off each day. My great aunt, cousin, or mother would get me one.. I would actually get through most of the month of January the way you're supposed to -- one each day, then forget about the calendar somewhere in the chaos that was my boyhood room. Eventually I'd find it, maybe in May or June, and sit and read through several months of words to catch up. I know, I'm exciting, right? Anyway that's the motivation for this project. The nice thing is that it brings words from five word-of-the-day websites so there's a pretty good chance for learning some new vocabular. Coding-wise, this project seems like a big step forward. For some reason it seems even more in-depth than the TTT project, maybe because scraping from the web is such a tedious process... I used bundler to build the program and essentially kept the default setup for the most part. Very excited to have finished it, and very excited to continue learning!!!!
