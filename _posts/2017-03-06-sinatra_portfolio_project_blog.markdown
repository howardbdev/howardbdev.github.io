March 6, 2017

I’m at a busy time in my life where schoolwork has taken a bit of a back seat to current job and life situation.  I feel like that’s on the brink of changing, though, and it’s a good feeling.
This is a very exciting part of curriculum.. actually making an active website!  Even if it’s just a locally-hosted, shotgun-run, largely-un-styled site, it’s still really cool.  I have tried making this site something I could use at work.  I’m finding that what I really want to do is go back and make changes and more changes and make it better and better.. then I realize there are a whole bunch of other circumstances where I would want the thing to act differently than it does, and suddenly I realize the changes I’m thinking about implementing will take five times more code than what I’ve already written.. and oh yeah, the point here is to understand what’s going on, not build a production-level website right now.  I’m thinking this will be part of web developing.. getting excited about ideas but then having to pare them down to what’s practical in a given situation for a given purpose.  
It’s still very satisfying to watch something work, and to feel the occasional but wonderful *click* inside my head when something finally makes sense that didn’t before.  I can’t wait to keep moving on!!!
